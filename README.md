**TRACE: Applying AI Language Models to Extract Ancestry Information from Curated Biomedical Literature**

> Automating ancestry identification in biomedical studies using GPT-4, regular expressions, and Cellosaurus crawling.

---

## Description

**TRACE (Tool for Researching Ancestry and Cell Extraction)** is a Python-based, open-source research tool that automates the extraction of ancestry-related information from biomedical research articles. TRACE identifies human cell lines or primary cultures mentioned in scientific texts and determines their associated ancestry by tracing external metadata (e.g., via Cellosaurus).

It uses a hybrid approach combining:

* **Regex-based extraction**
* **GPT-4-powered language understanding**
* **Web crawling to Cellosaurus**

TRACE was developed to address equity and transparency gaps in biomedical research, specifically the frequent underreporting and overrepresentation of certain ancestries in cell-based studies.

## Abstract

Ancestry reporting is essential to ensure transparency and proper representation in biomedical studies. However, manually extracting this information from study texts is time-consuming and inefficient. In this paper, we present **TRACE**, powered by GPT-4 and web crawling, to automate ancestry identification by detecting cell lines or cultures in texts and tracing their ancestry. We validated TRACE against a manually curated dataset and found substantial overrepresentation of European/White samples and widespread underreporting. TRACE enables large-scale, systematic ancestry analysis‚Äîa valuable resource for researchers and policymakers aiming to evaluate and improve representation in biomedical research.

## Examples / Demos

* Run `test.sh` or `test.py` to evaluate model accuracy.
* Try `webCrawler/` modules to enrich cell line metadata.
* Analyze results with `matplotlib` and `seaborn` in the `notebooks/` folder (optional).

---

## Configuration

* Requires GPT access via OpenAI API key.
* Input is one or more PDF files.
* Output is a CSV with cell line names, mentions, inferred ancestry.

## FAQ

**Q: Does TRACE work on non-human cells?**
A: No, TRACE is optimized for human cell line detection and ancestry estimation.

**Q: Can I use it without OpenAI/GPT?**
A: Yes, regex-only mode will partially work, but GPT enhances accuracy. We are also working on providing 

**Q: How is ancestry determined?**
A: TRACE matches the detected cell line to Cellosaurus entries and parses ancestry metadata using GPT.
